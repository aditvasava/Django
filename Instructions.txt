----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Install Django

Download and install python latest version from python.org, then open cmd with admin privileges

python (check if python is installed)
python -m pip install Django (Install django)
django-admin (check if django is installed properly)

###########################
Create a django project

Install these extensions in VS code
Python from microsoft
Pylance from microsoft

django-admin startproject [PROJECT-NAME]
django-admin startproject mypage

Above command creates a project structure like:

mypage
    - __init__.py
    - asgi.py
    - settings.py
    - urls.py
    - wsgi.py
manage.py

manage.py is not to be touched initially,
inside mypage directory, __init__.py is also not important as it just marks that this a folder that consists of python packages
asgi & wsgi files are used to deal with deployment stuff. The only 2 files that are important are settings.py & urls.py. And ofcourse,
our own custom .py files that we create to build project.

###########################
Start a development server

python manage.py runserver (usually starts at localhost:8000)

After running the server, it will automatically create a db.sqlite3 file in the folder, ignore this file

###########################
Create an App

python manage.py startapp [APP-NAME] (this command will create a folder similar to the one above "mypage")

app or module is similar to a feature of the project (Kind of like components in react app)
You're building google, so google is the main project, gmap, gmail, gimage can be said as apps

The only important file for now is the "views.py" file, this is the file which is used to display content on webpage

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
URLs (Routes) & Views

django-admin startproject monthly_challenges
python manage.py startapp challenges

Views - logic that is executed for different URLs. A view is basically just a python function that gets executed when request for a certain url 
reaches the server.

start the server

localhost:8000/challenges/january

go to ./challenges/views.py
define the function
create urls.py file inside challenges folder

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Templates & Static Files

So we want to send html files to user

Create a folder named "templates" in the challenges app (This name should always be "templates")
create a sub-folder named challenges in the templates and then create .html files inside it (The names inside the templates folder can be anything)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Template Language & Variable Interpolation

Django Template Language (DTL)

Standard HTML Syntax + Special DTL Syntax = Dynamic HTML content returned with response

For global templates & static files, create the folder with respective name at the root level of the project.
